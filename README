goblog is a toy blog written in Google Go as a pet project
to teach myself Go.

It makes use of Go's built in HTTP server, closures, templates
and template function creation and usage and JSON marshalling and
unmarshalling.

Blog entries are saved in JSON format on disk, in reverse order of creation
for simplicity. The submission page is not protected in any way, although
that could be done fairly simply.
